# Burger

## Description
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, then the burger will be displayed in the menu list on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. The app was created with MySQL, node.js, and handlebars. The application follows the MVC design pattern.

- The user enters the burger name and clicks on the add button, it displays the burger on the left side of the page.   
- When the user clicks on the burger from the menu to devour it, the burger moves to the right side of the page waiting to be devoured.

The app stores all the added burgers to the database.
